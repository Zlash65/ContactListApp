# ContactListApp

A simple Contact list app to get around Mean Stack development environment. The app essentially stores the contact that we add in 
mongo database and queries it back for the display. The app gives functionality to remove or edit entries from the database and update the details
on the display.

I've developed it using Flask-as-server as well as Node-as-server.
